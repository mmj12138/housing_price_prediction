# Housing Price Prediction

Project updated to use AmesHousing `train.csv` and `test.csv`. 
- Train is split into train/val.
- Features grouped into Structural and Socioeconomic (socioeconomic left empty initially).
- Outputs: baseline models, MLP, feature correlation, top-20 heatmap, and coefficient-based feature importance.

Place your `train.csv` and `test.csv` under `data/raw/` before running.
